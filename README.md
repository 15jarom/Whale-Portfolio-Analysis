# Whale-Portfolio-Analysis - Homework 3

For my Portfolio additions I chose to go with 3 ETFs that represent some new technologies at the time (2015) and see if investing into those would have yielded good returns. 

The 3 techs are Lithium Batteries, Bitcoin, and Artificial Intelligence which were not new, but on the rise as they were being integrated into big businesses.

I used ETFs instead of individual stocks to see if the overall industry sectors using these technologies would grow as a whole, instead of specific companies. 

My thought was I would see if these were passing fads or legitimate changes to the world based on performance over the 5 year window. 

Unsurprisingly given our hindsight now, these were a great investment for anyone at the time!
